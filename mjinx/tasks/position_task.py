class PositionTask(Task):
    r"""Regulate the pose of a robot frame in the world frame.

    Attributes:
        frame: Frame name, typically the name of a link or joint from the robot
            description.
        transform_target_to_world: Target pose of the frame.

    Costs are designed so that errors with varying SI units, here position and
    orientation displacements, can be cast to homogeneous values. For example,
    if task "foo" has a position cost of 1.0 and task "bar" a position cost of
    0.1, then a 1 [cm] error in task "foo" costs as much as a 10 [cm] error in
    task "bar".

    Note:
        Dimensionally, the 6D cost vector is a (normalized) force screw and our
        objective function is a (normalized) energy.
